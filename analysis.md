# Climate Litigation Analysis

## Initial Case Overview

As of December 2025, this database contains three foundational climate lawsuits that illustrate the diversity of legal strategies being employed to hold entities accountable for climate change.

### 1. **Juliana v. United States**
- **Status:** Active (though subject to repeated procedural challenges)
- **Legal Theory:** Constitutional (public trust doctrine, substantive due process)
- **Defendant:** U.S. government (`government-agency`)
- **Jurisdiction:** U.S. federal court
- **Significance:** This case represents a rights‑based approach, asserting that the federal government has a constitutional obligation to protect a stable climate system for future generations.

### 2. **City of Oakland v. BP p.l.c.**
- **Status:** Dismissed (by the Ninth Circuit in 2020)
- **Legal Theory:** Public nuisance
- **Defendants:** BP, Chevron, ConocoPhillips, ExxonMobil, Shell (`bp`, `chevron`, `exxonmobil`, `shell`, `other-corporate`)
- **Jurisdiction:** U.S. federal court
- **Significance:** One of several “climate‑cost recovery” suits filed by municipalities seeking compensation for adaptation costs. The dismissal turned on the court’s conclusion that federal common‑law nuisance claims are displaced by the Clean Air Act.

### 3. **Kivalina v. ExxonMobil**
- **Status:** Dismissed (by the Ninth Circuit in 2012)
- **Legal Theory:** Public nuisance
- **Defendants:** ExxonMobil, BP, Chevron, ConocoPhillips, Shell, and other energy companies (`exxonmobil`, `bp`, `chevron`, `shell`, `other-corporate`)
- **Jurisdiction:** U.S. federal court
- **Significance:** An early attempt to use federal common‑law nuisance to recover relocation costs for an Alaska Native village threatened by sea‑level rise. The dismissal similarly relied on displacement by the Clean Air Act.

## Emerging Patterns

### Legal Theories
Of the three initial cases, **public nuisance** is the most frequently invoked theory (two of three cases). The constitutional theory in *Juliana* represents a distinct, rights‑based strand of litigation that avoids some of the displacement hurdles faced by nuisance claims.

### Defendants
All three cases target either the federal government or major fossil‑fuel producers. The corporate‑focused suits overwhelmingly name the same set of integrated oil companies (`exxonmobil`, `shell`, `chevron`, `bp`), indicating a concentrated litigation strategy against the largest historical emitters.

### Jurisdiction
All three cases were filed in U.S. federal courts, reflecting the early dominance of U.S.‑based climate litigation. International and state‑court actions are expected to grow as the legal landscape evolves.

## Next Steps
- Track whether new cases adopt the constitutional‑rights model or continue to refine nuisance‑based claims.
- Monitor appellate developments, especially any Supreme Court review of displacement doctrine.
- Expand the database to include securities‑fraud, consumer‑protection, and international cases.
