# Climate Litigation Analysis

## Initial Case Overview

As of December 2025, this database contains four foundational climate lawsuits that illustrate the diversity of legal strategies being employed to hold entities accountable for climate change.

### 1. **Juliana v. United States**
- **Status:** Active (though subject to repeated procedural challenges)
- **Legal Theory:** Constitutional (public trust doctrine, substantive due process)
- **Defendant:** U.S. government (`government-agency`)
- **Jurisdiction:** U.S. federal court
- **Significance:** This case represents a rights‑based approach, asserting that the federal government has a constitutional obligation to protect a stable climate system for future generations.

### 2. **City of Oakland v. BP p.l.c.**
- **Status:** Dismissed (by the Ninth Circuit in 2020)
- **Legal Theory:** Public nuisance
- **Defendants:** BP, Chevron, ConocoPhillips, ExxonMobil, Shell (`bp`, `chevron`, `exxonmobil`, `shell`, `other-corporate`)
- **Jurisdiction:** U.S. federal court
- **Significance:** One of several “climate‑cost recovery” suits filed by municipalities seeking compensation for adaptation costs. The dismissal turned on the court’s conclusion that federal common‑law nuisance claims are displaced by the Clean Air Act.

### 3. **Kivalina v. ExxonMobil**
- **Status:** Dismissed (by the Ninth Circuit in 2012)
- **Legal Theory:** Public nuisance
- **Defendants:** ExxonMobil, BP, Chevron, ConocoPhillips, Shell, and other energy companies (`exxonmobil`, `bp`, `chevron`, `shell`, `other-corporate`)
- **Jurisdiction:** U.S. federal court
- **Significance:** An early attempt to use federal common‑law nuisance to recover relocation costs for an Alaska Native village threatened by sea‑level rise. The dismissal similarly relied on displacement by the Clean Air Act.

### 4. **Milieudefensie v. Shell**
- **Status:** Active (judgment upheld on appeal)
- **Legal Theory:** Tort / Duty of care under Dutch law
- **Defendant:** Shell plc (`shell`)
- **Jurisdiction:** Dutch court (international)
- **Significance:** In a landmark ruling, the Hague District Court ordered Shell to reduce its CO₂ emissions by 45% by 2030 relative to 2019 levels, finding that the company has a duty of care under Dutch law to contribute to preventing dangerous climate change. This case expands climate litigation beyond the U.S. and establishes a precedent for corporate responsibility based on human rights norms.

## Emerging Patterns

### Legal Theories
Of the four initial cases, **public nuisance** remains the most frequently invoked theory (two of four cases). The constitutional theory in *Juliana* represents a distinct, rights‑based strand of litigation that avoids some of the displacement hurdles faced by nuisance claims. The *Milieudefensie* case introduces a **tort/duty-of-care** approach grounded in domestic civil law, demonstrating the adaptability of climate claims to different legal systems.

### Defendants
All four cases target either the federal government or major fossil‑fuel producers. The corporate‑focused suits overwhelmingly name the same set of integrated oil companies (`exxonmobil`, `shell`, `chevron`, `bp`), indicating a concentrated litigation strategy against the largest historical emitters. The addition of *Milieudefensie* highlights that individual companies can be singled out for specific emissions‑reduction obligations.

### Jurisdiction
While the first three cases were filed in U.S. federal courts, reflecting the early dominance of U.S.‑based climate litigation, *Milieudefensie* shows the rapid growth of **international** actions. This expansion suggests that future climate accountability may increasingly be pursued in jurisdictions with favorable procedural rules or substantive law.

## Next Steps
- Track whether new cases adopt the constitutional‑rights model, continue to refine nuisance‑based claims, or follow the duty‑of‑care approach pioneered in the Netherlands.
- Monitor appellate developments, especially any Supreme Court review of displacement doctrine and the enforcement of the Shell judgment.
- Expand the database to include securities‑fraud, consumer‑protection, and more international cases.
- Encourage contributors to add cases from the Global South and from state‑level courts to capture the full spectrum of climate litigation.
